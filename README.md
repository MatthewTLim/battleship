Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would've approached the design and problem solving process.
We approached designing iteration 3 by going line by line in the directions and taking everything in small chunks. This allowed us to not get overwhelmed by the amount of information we were looking at.
If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
We would work on finishing iteration 3 and working on our random placement method as well as the firing phase.
Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
We primarily did driver navigator with a little bit of async work. Driver navigator was super beneficial for both of us as it allowed us to gain insights into how each other work and what strengths we can incorporate in our coding style
Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
Feedback was shared directly during coding sessions since we didnâ€™t do much async work. This was nice because it allowed us to have a free and open communication about how we felt the project was going as well as how our code looked and performed.
